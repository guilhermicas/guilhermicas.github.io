### why learn programming if someone else will do the boring stuff for you

I have grown to hate CRUD, george's fault. It's repetitive work that will be replaced by an AI that can translate business talk to code. (happened this week)  
So <b>what is it that i like, so that i can pursue it and give meaning for the rest of my life</b>.  

### I learned that i don't like herd thinking

I've noticed that when using social media, i despise unconsciously the zombie like herd movement in which people flow.<br><br>Is my feeling resentment?<br><br>After all it's social behaviour in an inherent social species, that also inherently lives in hierarchies.  
I guess my problem is, which hierarchy can i best feel better about being involved in it, and manifest myself onto it productively.<br><br>
I think helping people, but in an indirect way, where i can feel that i acomplished something, but without the congratulatory nature, which in itself is part of the dilema of people on lower positions in hierarchies.  So, i can better define herd mentality as group thinking, and rationalizing it makes me realise i prefer progressive individualistic societies. Group thinking promotes things that don't exist, and if they exist it doesn't matter, or maybe this is true in the social/political sense.

### is phylosophy really for high schoolers who just discovered smoking weed?
[question inspired by this](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/10/29/an-architecture-for-life.html "An Architecture for Life")  
I want to find a deep phylosophical meaning to motivate myself through life, but is it necessary to have a phylosophical meaning at all?  Family well being keeps popping up. The family ambient in which i live today makes it so i feel complexly repressed about moving forward, even though i want to, but i cant(?), and i might be the only cure because i see a possible future that my family can't.<br><br>But even with all that, why is it still difficult? Is it discipline? <b>Does a moral highground really overrule this?</b><br><br>
If no, we become nihilistic, nothing matters, we play games all day, we accomplish nothing, disaster occurs and we feel like we can do nothing about it and we watch the world crumble without outwardly feeling anything, but feeling emptyness from the inside.  
If yes, we need to answer another question, what makes life worthwhile to sacrifice stuff for a greater future good? Also, since we live here, atleast lets try to make the best of it, seems like a better alternative than indefinite nihilism.

### being good will make you be pursued, instead of marketing yourself like corporate shills on linkedin/instagram/wtv..

but why be good? To help family, to deviate from living a nihilistic life. But what if the life i want to live is in the woods, no tech, simple plain old life (which we see happen all the time with members of high positions in social hierarchies, especially technology). Is what i like dilemas?  Is it better to play chess, or to play sandbox? This is complex enough for today.

### Hierarchy of needs
maybe my dilema is that i need to check on this.

last note, i find it funny that george despises this thinking inherently through his personality.
